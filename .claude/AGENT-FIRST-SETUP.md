# Agent-First Claude Code Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Transform Claude Code to Prioritize Agents

This system modifies Claude Code to automatically route **95%+ requests** to specialized agents with intelligent fallback mechanisms.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Copy Agent-First Configuration
```bash
# From the award-winning-agents directory
cp -r .claude/* ~/.claude/

# Verify configuration files
ls ~/.claude/config/
# Should show: agent-registry.json, router.json, routing-rules.json
```

### 2. Test the Routing System
```bash
# Test the agent router directly
cd ~/.claude/scripts
python agent-router.py "I have a Flutter app that crashes on startup"

# Expected output:
# Selected Agent: deep-research-issue-fixer
# Confidence: 0.95
# Use Task Tool: False
# Reasoning: High confidence match: Primary keywords matched: flutter, crashes, app
# Fallback Chain: qa-testing-specialist -> research-specialist -> task_tool_general -> direct_execution
```

### 3. Enable Agent-First Mode in Claude Code

Add to your `~/.claude/config/claude-code-config.json`:
```json
{
  "agent_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "router_script": "~/.claude/scripts/agent-router.py",
    "fallback_enabled": true,
    "debug_routing": false
  },
  "default_behavior": "agent_first"
}
```

## How It Works

### Routing Decision Flow
```
User Request â†’ Keyword Analysis â†’ Agent Matching â†’ Confidence Scoring â†’ Routing Decision
     â†“                â†“               â†“              â†“                    â†“
"Debug error"  â†’ [debug, error] â†’ deep-research- â†’ 0.95 confidence â†’ Route to Agent
                                   issue-fixer
```

### Fallback Hierarchy
1. **Primary Agent** (95% confidence): Direct routing to specialized agent
2. **Secondary Agent** (80% confidence): Primary + backup agent options  
3. **Task Tool** (60% confidence): Use Task tool with agent consultation
4. **Direct Execution** (<60% confidence): Standard Claude Code behavior

## Configuration Examples

### High-Priority Routing Rules
```json
{
  "pattern": "(debug|error|issue|problem|bug)",
  "agent": "deep-research-issue-fixer", 
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "fallback": ["qa-testing-specialist", "research-specialist"]
}
```

### Agent Registry Entry
```json
{
  "name": "deep-research-issue-fixer",
  "priority": 10,
  "domains": ["debugging", "troubleshooting", "analysis"],
  "primary_keywords": ["debug", "error", "issue", "problem", "bug"],
  "activation_threshold": 0.8,
  "auto_delegate": true
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Before Agent-First
```bash
claude "My Flutter app crashes on iOS"
# â†’ Standard Claude response, may lack specialized debugging expertise
```

### After Agent-First
```bash
claude "My Flutter app crashes on iOS"
# â†’ Automatically routes to deep-research-issue-fixer
# â†’ Applies sequential thinking methodology
# â†’ Performs comprehensive web research
# â†’ Provides evidence-based solutions with validation
```

## Expected Results

### Performance Metrics
- **95%+ Agent Usage**: Nearly all requests routed to specialized agents
- **Higher Quality**: Consistent award-winning standards across responses
- **Faster Resolution**: Specialized expertise reduces iteration cycles
- **Better Context**: Agents maintain domain-specific knowledge

### Routing Statistics
```
Agent Usage Breakdown:
â”œâ”€â”€ deep-research-issue-fixer: 25%
â”œâ”€â”€ flutter-mobile-development: 20% 
â”œâ”€â”€ tech-lead-architect: 15%
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend-specialist: 12%
â”œâ”€â”€ backend-specialist: 10%
â”œâ”€â”€ Other agents: 13%
â””â”€â”€ Direct execution: <5%
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Agent Priorities
```json
{
  "priority_overrides": {
    "deep-research-issue-fixer": 10,
    "flutter-mobile-development": 9,
    "kurdish-specialist": 9
  }
}
```

### Confidence Thresholds
```json
{
  "confidence_levels": {
    "high_confidence": 0.9,
    "medium_confidence": 0.7,
    "low_confidence": 0.5,
    "fallback_threshold": 0.3
  }
}
```

### Learning & Optimization
```json
{
  "learning": {
    "track_success_rates": true,
    "adjust_thresholds": true,
    "cache_successful_patterns": true,
    "feedback_integration": true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Enable Routing Analytics
```bash
# Add to ~/.claude/config/router.json
{
  "performance_monitoring": true,
  "analytics": {
    "track_agent_usage": true,
    "measure_response_quality": true,
    "log_routing_decisions": true,
    "generate_reports": true
  }
}
```

### View Routing Reports
```bash
python ~/.claude/scripts/routing-analytics.py --report daily
# Shows agent usage, success rates, and optimization opportunities
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Agents not being selected
**Solution**: Check confidence thresholds in `router.json`

**Issue**: Wrong agent selection
**Solution**: Update keywords in `agent-registry.json`

**Issue**: Performance degradation  
**Solution**: Enable caching and parallel evaluation

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
python agent-router.py "test request" --debug

# Shows detailed routing decision process:
# - Keyword extraction
# - Agent matching scores
# - Confidence calculations
# - Final routing decision
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### MCP Server Compatibility
The agent-first system works seamlessly with all existing MCP servers:
- Agents inherit tool access from main Claude Code instance
- No changes needed to existing MCP configurations
- Enhanced tool usage through specialized agents

### Command Integration
All existing commands work with agent routing:
```bash
claude "/flutter-new my-app"     # â†’ flutter-mobile-development agent
claude "/debug --deep error"     # â†’ deep-research-issue-fixer agent  
claude "/research --latest tech" # â†’ research-specialist agent
```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Agent Evaluation
```json
{
  "parallel_evaluation": true,
  "max_concurrent_agents": 3,
  "evaluation_timeout": 5000
}
```

### Caching Strategy
```json
{
  "caching": {
    "cache_agent_matches": true,
    "cache_duration": 3600,
    "cache_size_limit": 1000
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Target KPIs
- **Agent Usage Rate**: >95%
- **First-Response Accuracy**: >90%
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.8/5
- **Resolution Time**: <50% reduction

### Quality Gates
- All responses maintain award-winning standards
- Consistent application of specialized expertise  
- Evidence-based solutions with validation
