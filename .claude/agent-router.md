# Agent-First Routing System

## System Architecture

### 1. Request Analysis & Agent Matching
```
User Request → Keyword Analysis → Agent Selection → Task Delegation → Fallback (if needed)
```

### 2. Priority Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Specialized agents (15 available agents)
2. **Secondary**: General-purpose task tool 
3. **Tertiary**: Direct Claude Code execution
4. **Fallback**: Standard Claude responses

## Implementation Strategy

### A. Agent Router Configuration

Create intelligent routing logic that:
- Analyzes incoming requests for keywords and context
- Matches requests to available specialized agents
- Automatically delegates with fallback chains
- Maintains performance metrics for optimization

### B. Enhanced Agent Activation

```markdown
# Enhanced Agent Definitions with Auto-Activation

Each agent now includes:
- Primary keywords (strong match)
- Secondary keywords (moderate match) 
- Context patterns (situational match)
- Confidence thresholds (when to activate)
- Fallback chains (what to try next)
```

### C. Fallback Mechanisms

**Level 1 - Specialized Agent**
- Direct agent match based on keywords/context
- 95% of requests should route here

**Level 2 - Task Tool Delegation** 
- Use general-purpose task tool for complex analysis
- When no specific agent matches but task is complex

**Level 3 - Hybrid Approach**
- Combine agent consultation with direct execution
- For edge cases requiring multiple perspectives

**Level 4 - Direct Execution**
- Standard Claude Code functionality
- Only for simple, non-specialized tasks

## Implementation Files

### 1. Agent Selection Logic
```bash
# ~/.claude/scripts/agent-router.py
def select_agent(user_input, context):
    # Keyword analysis
    keywords = extract_keywords(user_input)
    context_signals = analyze_context(context)
    
    # Agent matching with confidence scores
    agent_matches = []
    for agent in available_agents:
        score = calculate_match_score(keywords, context_signals, agent)
        if score > agent.threshold:
            agent_matches.append((agent, score))
    
    # Sort by confidence and return best match
    return sorted(agent_matches, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### 2. Routing Configuration
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "agent_priority": true,
    "minimum_confidence": 0.7,
    "fallback_enabled": true,
    "fallback_chain": [
      "specialized_agent",
      "task_tool_general",
      "hybrid_approach", 
      "direct_execution"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Agent Definitions

Each agent file now includes routing metadata:

```markdown
---
name: deep-research-issue-fixer
activation_threshold: 0.8
primary_keywords: [debug, error, issue, problem, bug, broken]
secondary_keywords: [not working, fails, crashes, exception, investigate]
context_patterns: [stack_trace, error_message, performance_issue]
fallback_agents: [qa-testing-specialist, research-specialist]
auto_delegate: true
---
```

## Routing Decision Matrix

| Request Type | Primary Agent | Secondary | Fallback | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Flutter Development | flutter-mobile-development | tech-lead-architect | task-tool | Mobile-specific |
| Debug Issues | deep-research-issue-fixer | qa-testing-specialist | research-specialist | Sequential analysis |
| Performance | web-performance | devops-engineer | tech-lead-architect | Platform-specific |
| Documentation | documentation-coordinator | technical-writer | context-manager | Strategic approach |
| Architecture | tech-lead-architect | backend-specialist | product-manager | System-wide |

## Performance Optimizations

### A. Caching & Learning
- Cache successful agent-task pairings
- Learn from user feedback and correction patterns
- Adjust confidence thresholds based on success rates

### B. Parallel Evaluation
- Evaluate multiple agents simultaneously for complex requests
- Use confidence scores to rank and select optimal approach
- Enable multi-agent collaboration when beneficial

### C. Context Preservation
- Maintain conversation context across agent delegations
- Share relevant context between agents in same session
- Preserve learning across multiple interactions

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Higher Quality Responses
- Specialized expertise for every domain
- Consistent application of best practices
- Award-winning standards automatically applied

### 2. Better Context Utilization
- Agents have deeper domain knowledge
- More focused and relevant solutions
- Reduced context waste on generic responses

### 3. Improved User Experience
- More accurate first-time responses
- Consistent quality across all domains
- Transparent routing with explanation capability

### 4. Scalable Architecture
- Easy to add new specialized agents
- Configurable routing rules
- Performance monitoring and optimization

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "fallback": ["qa-testing-specialist", "research-specialist"]
